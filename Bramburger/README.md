# README

This folder contains the auto07p files and Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the data and plots presented in figures 6 and 7 of [JJ Bramburger, D Altschuler, CI Avery, T Sangsawang, M Beck, P Carter, and B Sandstede: _Localized radial roll patterns in higher space dimensions](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/sandsted/publications.html).

## To reproduce visualizations

The notebook [Reproduce-Visualizations.ipynb](Reproduce-Visualizations.ipynb) plots the data files contained in the folder "data". The notebook  requires a python installation (python 2.7 and 3.7 will both work) with matplotlib, jupyter, numpy, and pandas.

## To reproduce auto07p computations

The notebook [Reproduce-Auto-Computations.ipynb](Reproduce-Auto-Computations.ipynb) recreates the data files contained in the folder "data". The notebook requires (i) an auto07p installation and (ii) a python 2.7 installation with matplotlib=1.5.3, jupyter, numpy, and pandas (see below for an installation guide).

## Installing auto07p

The repository [Auto07p](https://github.com/sandstede-lab/Auto07p) contains information about the installation of auto07p.
